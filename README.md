# Open Data Capture Platform Overview

This Overview repository is a specification and documentation component of the Open Data Capture Platform Project. Please do not add code or other resources to this repository.

The goal of this project is to enable the capture and update of city scale Open Data.

Open Data should be captured and stored in meaningfully-segregated tables, using geographical information systems (GIS) best practices wherever possible, or enabling equivalent best practice access and maniupulation.

## Organization Workflow

All Innovate for Vegas Foundation projects, whether CodeFor or CreateFor, assume contributors and collaborators are familiar with the HOWTOs that detail such things as use of GitHub, the difference between CodeFor and CreateFor parts of our organization, and our approach to Agile for Volunteers (or Volunteer Agile) which will, like all our projects, be a collaborative work in progress. These, coupled with the Contributing document linked above, are important and you should be familiar with them before diving in.

## General Focus Areas

This is a large and ongoing project with multiple components. Each focus area will likely require at least one component, which may be code found in github, or which may be some other component found elsewhere but tracked in github either directly or indirectly. Examples of these latter components include visual layout, icons and logos and other creative assets, videos and other larger creative assets, and so on.

## Specification Documents

The specification(s) for the various components and goals of this project are located in the [Doc](doc/README.md) directory. Note that there should be localized versions of the specification documents as needed in this subdirectory.

## Project Backlog

As this project adds component repositories, specific GitHub issues may be opened against individual repos for relevant bugs, missing features, and so on. Prior to the relevant repository existing, an issue backlog may be created against this overview repository. When an appropriate component repository has been created, an issue may be created against the repository with a reference to the issue opened against this overview repository (Double-linking is encouraged).
